MALL CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION

Customer segmentation (also known as market segmentation) is the division of potential customers in a given market into discrete groups. That division is based on customers having similar enough: Needs, i.e., so that a single whole product can satisfy them and Buying characteristics, i.e., responses to messaging, marketing channels, and sales channels, that a single go-to-market approach can be used to sell to them competitively and economically. 

PROBLEM

To make predictions and find clusters of potential customers' of the mall and thus help Marketing Team to plan the strategy accordingly. Here, we try to understand basic customers' data and find who can be Target Customers' that bring additional revenue to the mall.

DATA

This is a Kaggle problem. The data contains 5 columns viz., CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income(k$) and Spending Score(1-100). Here, Gender is Categorical whereas rest are Numeric in nature. The dimensions of the data are (200,5). The data doesn't contain any missing values. 

ALGORITHM & MODEL

K-Means Algorithm is used to form clusters of customers' having similar characteristics. K-Means model is used with number of clusters 5 (Using Elbow Method). 

SOFTWARE USED

The software used is Python. Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook are the libraries used for this project.
