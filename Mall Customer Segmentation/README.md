MALL CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION

Customer segmentation (also known as market segmentation) is the division of potential customers in a given market into discrete groups. That division is based on customers having similar enough:
1.Needs, i.e., so that a single whole product can satisfy them.
2.Buying characteristics, i.e., responses to messaging, marketing channels, and sales channels, that a single go-to-market approach can be used to sell to them competitively and economically.
